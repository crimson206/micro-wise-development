## Vision

Software development stands at a crossroads, where traditional methodologies meet the emerging capabilities of AI. Our vision is to bridge this gap through a revolutionary approach to module development and system integration.

### Current Limitations in AI Development

Today's AI cannot independently develop massive and sophisticated projects like [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) or [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook). This limitation stems from constraints in how much context AI can process and the inherent dependency of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on probabilistic data retrieval rather than logical reasoning.

These limitations might eventually be addressed through advancements in computational hardware like GPUs or the evolution of RAG technologies by leading researchers. However, perhaps the real bottleneck lies not in the limitations of current AI technology, but in the traditional ways we approach software development itself.

### The Micro-Wise Solution

Micro-Wise Development aims to redefine this approach by making all modules fully comprehensible to AI. Each module is systematically abstracted, enabling clear relationships between components. With this methodology, AI could experiment with, develop, and integrate micro-modules, ultimately automating the creation of highly complex systems through iterative refinement of these smaller units.

### A New Paradigm for Human Developers

This vision is not limited to AI programming. It is also a direction that we, as human developers, must embrace. For too long, we have knowingly ignored inefficiencies in our development practices. However, as AI plays a larger role in programming, these inefficiencies are becoming increasingly apparent.

Innovators who recognize and overcome these challenges—applying methodologies like Micro-Wise Development—will shape the future and lead the market.
