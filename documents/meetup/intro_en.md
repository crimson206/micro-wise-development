Join the emergence of MWD (Micro-Wise Development).

MWD is an innovative new development methodology that limits all modules to a small size and develops them in separate repositories.

You can find the basic concepts in the following.

The main activity is to join the group and work on your own projects.
At this time, the goal is for all developers to build their projects based on MWD.
To this end, I, as the creator of this methodology, will guide beginners on how to get started with MWD.
Members who have become familiar with MWD are encouraged to continue participating in events, working on their own projects while helping other beginners.

MWD is already a complete methodology in itself, but organizing it further and gaining the maximum benefit from it still depends on our efforts.
We hope that those who have already started practicing MWD can come together regularly to discuss how to further develop and utilize it.

**Prerequisites**

- Proficient Python skills
- Willingness to formally learn and apply type hints
- Interest in clean code
- Comfort with pip module distribution (prior experience not necessary)

**Note**

- This provides an explanation of how development is carried out according to the MWD methodology, but it does not include instructions on how to develop software itself.

**Additional Information**

Currently, MWD has been significantly generalized in Python. However, it is still lacking in other languages. We welcome skilled developers to take the first steps toward generalizing MWD in other languages.
